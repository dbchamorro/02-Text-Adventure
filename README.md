# 02-Text-Adventure
The purpose of this program is to create a game engine that can generate an Interactive fiction game based on eternal files. 

I wrote the zombie.json code. The story isnt that long or detailed but it fits the requirements for location and use. I also took inspiration from the Walking Dead!
